## Developed by Alexander Baatz  
I chose to make the main code a library instead of a runnable console or web application because this allows the tracker to be run on any console or web application instead of locking it down into having to be run independently. For example, this package could be imported into an already operational analytics web api and just expose methods to interact with it instead of having to spin up another service to do this one job.
